   <p>Sprite is my preferred beverage because it’s crisp, refreshing, and never overwhelming. The lemon-lime flavor feels clean, the carbonation hits just right, and the sweetness stays balanced instead of heavy. Ice-cold, it’s perfect on hot days, with salty snacks, or when I need a quick pick-me-up. Sprite feels familiar and nostalgic, yet always dependable, making it my go-to drink for everyday moments, casual gatherings, and simple enjoyment that I happily reach for again and again.</p>
